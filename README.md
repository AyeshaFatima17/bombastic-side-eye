# bombastic-side-eye

This is a simple and fun web project based on the popular "bombastic-side-eye" meme. It's built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to bring some personality and humor to the screen.

## What it does
- Displays a side eye animation or interaction
- Works on both desktop and mobile browsers
- Just a creative way to practice web development skills

## How to use
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. That's it — enjoy the side eye

## Why I made it
This project was a fun way to practice front-end development while bringing a bit of meme culture into code. Nothing too serious — just learning and experimenting.
